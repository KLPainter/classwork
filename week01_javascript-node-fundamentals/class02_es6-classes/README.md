# Class 02: ES6 Classes and Complexity

Use classes

## Learning Objectives


* Understand class, constructor functions, and factory functions
* Have an understanding of node errors
* Understand runtime complexity

## Agenda

## Destructuring objects and arrays

* Array destructuring
* Object destructuring 

### Classes and object creation

* allow us to group common functions together
* allow us to store state 
* Are just syntax around objects (constructor functions and factories)

### Error messages

* try / catch
* why throw errors

### Big O

[Big O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

* O(1): random access to an element in a collection, dependent on indexing
* O(n): list iterations
* O(n^2): nested loops on the same collection
* O(log n): divide and conquer
* O(n log n): iterations that use divide and conquer
* O(n!): adding a nested loop for every input you have

## Demo

* Implement stringer
    * Reverse words
    * Reverse letters
* Implement some
* Implement every
