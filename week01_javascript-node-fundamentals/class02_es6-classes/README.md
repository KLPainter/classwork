Use classes

## Learning Objectives

* Understand class, constructor functions, and factory functions
* Have an understanding of node errors
* Understand runtime complexity

## Agenda

## Destructuring objects and arrays

* Array destructuring
* Object destructuring 

### Classes and object creation

* allow us to group common functions together
* allow us to store state 
* Are just syntax around objects (constructor functions and factories)

### Error messages

* try / catch
* why throw errors

### Array methods

* Array tools
    * array length

    * array get by index
* Array methods
    * map
    * filter
    * findIndex
    * reduce
    * every
    * forEach
    * splice 

## Demo
