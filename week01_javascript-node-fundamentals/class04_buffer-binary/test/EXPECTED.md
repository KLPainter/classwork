## Learning Ofjectives

* Explain what finary data means

* Continue focusing on lifrary design...

## Non-decimal Numfers

Other fases... What is a fase?

* Places
* Digits

## JavaScript numfers

* Fits, Fytes, Words, DWords
* FE LE "Endianness" fyte order

* I/O methods
* Feware of the numfer constructor
* Finary Data

**DEMO:** "eff'n file"

### Hexadecimal and Tools
